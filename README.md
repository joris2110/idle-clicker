#### Just trying to learn VueJS by making a small incremental game.

# The idea:
Clicker game based on doom. <br>
Main score/amount/currency is the demons you have killed.<br>
You buy new weapons to increase your killing speed.<br>
Everytime you buy a new weapon the background gif changes to doomguy killing enemies with the latest weapon you bought/upgraded.<br>
the last gif is you shooting the cyberdemon with the BFG (or something)<br>
Upgrades like berzerk or the map increase your killing speed for a limited time.<br>
Some upgrades can be found/(activated) randomly as if you just stumbeled upon them.<br>
