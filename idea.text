Clicker game based on doom.
Main score/amount/currency is the demons you have killed.
You buy new weapons to increase your killing speed.
Everytime you buy a new weapon the background gif changes to doomguy killing enemies with the latest weapon you bought/upgraded
the last gif is you shooting the cyberdemon with the BFG (or something)
Upgrades like berzerk or the map increase your killing speed for a limited time.
Some upgrades can be found/(activated) randomly as if you just stumbeled upon them.
